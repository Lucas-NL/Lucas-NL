- Hello there, Iâ€™m @Lucas-NL!
  - I have a master's degree in High Energy Physics (UFRGS - Brazil), in collaboration with the ALICE experiment at CERN.
  - In my research, I've worked on code development (C++) for analysis of data from ultrarelativistic collision simulations (Monte Carlo simulations), trying some machine learning features, as well (TMVA/C++ and Scikit-learn/Python).
  - Currently I'm interested in machine learning and data science, but I also have a growing interest in ethical hacking.
