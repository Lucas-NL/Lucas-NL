- Hello there, Iâ€™m @Lucas-NL!
  - I have a master's degree in High Energy Physics (UFRGS - Brazil), in collaboration with the ALICE experiment at CERN.
  - In my research, I've worked on code development (C++) for analysis of data from ultrarelativistic collision simulations (Monte Carlo simulations), trying some machine learning features, as well (TMVA/C++ and Scikit-learn/Python). You can acces the main features of my work at the botton of this ReadMe. Feel free to take a look and ask some questions.
  - Currently I'm interested in machine learning and data science, but I also have a growing interest in ethical hacking.

- Work on interface for ROOT's TMVA Machine Learning methods on the ALICE O2 software. (Full fork [here](https://github.com/Lucas-NL/GlobalMuonTracking))
  - The three following PR's have the main commits of the work:
    - [Interface implementation](https://github.com/rpezzi/GlobalMuonTracking/pull/1)
    - [Interface updates](https://github.com/MFT-MCHMatching/GlobalMuonTracking/pull/12)
    - [New methods and options](https://github.com/MFT-MCHMatching/GlobalMuonTracking/pull/21)

- Development which lead to my master dissertation:
  - [Assessments of track reconstruction](https://github.com/rpezzi/AliceO2/commit/5ce41c19861b3f82713a18de9da1b72a57d112fc)
  - Have a look at the results in my [dissertation](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/252032)!
